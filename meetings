===========
Assumptions that we can safely make are:
- All H/W interrupts are registered as interrupt gates
- Interrupt handlers don't re-enable interrupts
- `int` instructions are not invoked on interrupt gates
- H/W interrupts don't look above/below the interrupt frame in the stack. (Because the stack is not same during replay as of now)

NOTE: Interrupt handlers vs Trap handlers
